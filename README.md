Task: make an executable JAR file with a game in JavaFX using the graphics engine from JavaRush.

Steps:
* Fork the repository https://github.com/vasylmalik/project-maven
* Add necessary dependencies and plagins
* Configure maven-surefire-plugin so that the StrangeTest does not run during the build. The remaining tests must run.
* Add a “resources” section
